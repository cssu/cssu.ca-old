## Typography
The "CSSU" text in the logo uses [Nexa Light](http://fontfabric.com/nexa-free-font/). All other text uses [Open Sans](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans).

## Colours
In general, CSSU materials use an achromatic colour scheme, but colour is welcome as part of promotional materials for events.

<div class="branding-colour" id="branding-colour__dark-grey">#0d1117</div>
<div class="branding-colour" id="branding-colour__mid-grey">#18191a</div>
<div class="branding-colour" id="branding-colour__grey">#262626</div>
<div class="branding-colour" id="branding-colour__light-grey">#d5d5d5</div>
<div class="branding-colour" id="branding-colour__lighter-grey">#efefef</div>

## Logo variants
Generally, the icon with the "CSSU" text superimposed on top of the emblem should be used.

- [Dark variant with opaque background](/downloads/logo/icon/icon_dark.png)
- [Dark with variant transparent background](/downloads/logo/icon/icon_dark_transparent.png)
- [Light variant with opaque background](/downloads/logo/icon/icon_light.png)
- [Light variant with transparent background](/downloads/logo/icon/icon_light_transparent.png)

In cases where a single hue is needed, use the full (horizontal) variant, as that allows for both the text and emblem to be shown.

- [Dark variant](/downloads/logo/full/full_dark.png)
- [Light variant](/downloads/logo/full/full_light.png)

The "retro" variant is also provided, based on the original logo from 1981.
