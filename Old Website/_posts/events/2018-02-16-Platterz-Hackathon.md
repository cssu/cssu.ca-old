Hungry for hacking? From on-demand delivery services, to predictive technology, food tech is changing the way we eat. On February 16th in BA3200, join Platterz and the CSSU for 24 hours as we get together to remix the food industry and find innovative solutions towards improving food-related tech. Come meet other food and tech-lovers, bring an idea to life, eat a bunch of pizza, and have a lot of fun! The details: Your hack should be related to food, and should be as creative as you like! There are prizes for hacks related to supporting health, generating leads for a particular service, and the use of a chatbot. It should be a functioning app or prototype. No cost to participate. Unlimited pizza & drinks! The prizes: Lots of awesome tech prizes, including: PS4, Xbox One, VR headset, drone, headphones, nerf gun and more. Opportunity for an internship at Platterz. Whoâ€™s invited: Any and all U of T students in teams of 1-4. All skill sets are welcome, from developers, to UX/UI designers, to marketing experts and foodies! Please make sure each team member registers individually.
