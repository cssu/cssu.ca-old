Have questions about POST? Wondering what resources are available for you? Want to know more about the CS program?

Join us for a conversation with several faculty members of the Department of Computer Science, including Francois Pitt, Danny Heap, David Liu, Estina Boddie and Beatrix Doma, this Friday March 2nd from 5PM to 7PM in BA1200! Pizza will also be served courtesy of the DCS, who are sponsoring this event! 

This is your chance to ask any questions you have about CS at UofT. This could include questions on courses, study spaces, research opportunities, or program requirements. Take this time to share any concerns effecting your experience and make your voice heard! Our objective is to generate discussion and gather input for the continued improvement of DCS. 

So get your questions ready and don't forget to drop by!
