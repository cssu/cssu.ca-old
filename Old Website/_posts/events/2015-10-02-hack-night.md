It’s time.

CSSU Hack Nights are here. They’re real and we’re hitting the ground running with our first one happening on October 2nd, 4pm at BA3200. Sign up now by filling out this [Google form](http://goo.gl/forms/DY35oN210G)!

This is an opportunity for students to come together and HACK. Whether you’re looking to build the next Facestagram, Instatweet, or Facetweet+, Hack Night is the event to be so you can get it all done.

Bring your friends, bring your neighbors, and even bring your grandmother. We’ll have arrays of mentors to get you started and answer your questions such as:

Git vs SVN?
What’s the worst thing that can happen if I use PHP?
How do I invert a binary tree?
Can every problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer can also be quickly solved by a computer?

It doesn’t matter if you’re a Code Cub or Ninja, we got you covered.

We will also be hosting a tech talk by Arseniy V Ivanov, a past lead-developer from 500px, one of Toronto’s fastest growing startups.

Free food, good code, and awesome company. What more could you ask for?

We hope to see you there!

Special thanks to Google for sponsoring us!

<br />

**_I don’t know how to code, should I still come?_**

Yes. We want to be your friend and you probably don’t want to miss out on the awesome talk Arseniy is giving. If you want to start a project but don’t know how to, politely make eye contact with one of our mentors and he/she will be more than happy to get you started.

**_Will there be food?_**

Yes.

**_Can I still come even if I’m not in CS?_**

Yes.

**_I really dig what you guys are doing, is there any way I can help in partnerships/sponsorships?_**

Yes, please send an email to [utcssu@gmail.com](mailto:utcssu@gmail.com) and we’ll have our people talk to your people.
