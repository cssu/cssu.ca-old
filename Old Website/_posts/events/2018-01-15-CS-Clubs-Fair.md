Looking to get involved in CS Clubs but not sure where to start? Drop by BA3200 on January 15th, 12:30-2:30 to hear from some of the Computer-Science related Clubs at U of T! All of them are looking for new members like you!

If you're a CS-related club that would like to be at this event, please email utcssu@gmail.com
