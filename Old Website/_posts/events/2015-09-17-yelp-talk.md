Talk abstract: We have a lot of Full stack Web Developers at Yelp. Building a single web application filled with those engineers implementing new features is chaotic. You need to write a ton of tests to avoid regressions, aggressively monitor everything and when you need to make infrastructure changes it can be really scary. Come hear Toronto alum, Ken S., speak about working to move our Frontend to a Service Oriented Architecture to make more incremental changes and we think the lessons learned/motivations behind it are really useful to anyone going into our industry.

At our tech talk, we're providing food and drinks from Rasta Pasta, and raffling off an iPad Mini w/Retina, so remember to bring your CS or engineering resume to get a raffle ticket!
