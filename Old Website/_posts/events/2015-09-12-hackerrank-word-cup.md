Hey, incoming freshmen and seniors alike! We're happy to invite you to the ultimate university code competition, the World Cup Codesprint hosted by **HackerRank**! 

HackerRank is a website for mastering computer science domains through programming challenges. Form a team and represent UofT in the qualifiers round, which is taking place **September 11th - 13th**! 

A room will be available in the Bahen Centre for those of you who want to code onsite with your fellow students, receive T-shirt and sticker swag, and chow down on a courtesy dinner. We have 20 T-shirts to give away to the top 20 coders!
