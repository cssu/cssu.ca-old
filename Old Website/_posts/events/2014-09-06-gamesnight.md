To go along with our first ever CS Frosh Day we're following it with our first Games Night â€” and it's before the school year even starts! It won't be going all night (it will be ending at midnight), but it will be a great opportunity to meet up with all your friends that you've missed over the summer and to see the incoming first years!

You can RSVP on the [Facebook event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/165836586950220/).

Hope to see you there!
