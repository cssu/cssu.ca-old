Welcome to the second post of the CSSU Blog our weekly blog series with news, events, tips and everything else you need to know. For those of you who don't know what this is you can find my first post [here](https://cssu.ca/news/2018/10/05/CSSU-update.html). As always thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this.

‘Tis the season for midterms, assignments, and all the "wonderful" things that make up university life. While the weather has been cooling down, your coursework has been heating up and the CSSU has been busy making plans for lots of events and activities to give you a break.

With all of these tests, assignments, and coursework, you can feel overwhelmed. Make sure that you’re taking care of yourself; stress is serious. You can visit [our health page](https://cssu.ca/heath) for health resources and if you ever need a place to relax the CSSU is here.

Without further ado, let's get into this week's content:

## News:

1. The CSSU is having its first open General Member Meeting of the year on Thursday Oct. 18th from 5pm - 6:30pm.

## Tip of the week
You can SSH onto the teaching labs from your personal computer with your username and password. [Click Here](https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/using_cdf/ssh.html) for details on how to set it up (Putty is brilliant for windows). This is really useful for when you need to run your code on the teach machines (for 2nd year and above courses where compiling and running C code on windows is a pain) without needing to be in the lab. For the veteran users who know that already, there are actually multiple servers that you can ssh into if the main one is really busy (really helps in high traffic times like when a CSC369 or CSC320 assignment is due or MATLAB). yelp and jwebb are the servers and all you need is to ssh into the regular teach.cs.toronto.edu and from there ssh (server_name), remember to use the machines responsibly.

## Interesting Links
