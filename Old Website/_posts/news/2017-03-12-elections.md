- All other posters may only be posted on bulletin boards or other areas designated for flyers by Facilities and Services. This means no posters on walls, doors, windows, washroom walls, poles, garbage cans, trees, etc.
- Do not remove or obstruct other posters that are current
- No material that may be deemed inappropriate, discriminatory, or offensive. Keep it PG
- No libel, slander, or harassment of other candidates

- No direct exchange of money or goods for votes
- No soliciting for advance votes

Any questions about these rules should be directed to the CRO. Candidates found to be in violation of the rules maybe reprimanded and/or disqualified, up to the CRO’s discretion. These rules may be modified by the CRO at any time throughout the campaign period.
