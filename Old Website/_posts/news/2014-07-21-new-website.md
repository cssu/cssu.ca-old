There's a good chance that you're here because you've heard there's a shiny new CSSU website. If so, hello there! If not, welcome to the website, I hope you like it!

I just wanted to answer a few questions that some people might have and let you know what's going on with the new website.

### Why the massive change?
It's a new year and in fact, it's the [Department of Computer Science](http://web.cs.toronto.edu/)'s 50th anniversary this year! Because of this, there's all sorts of things happening around the department, and it just so happens that we're getting a nice brand refresh too.

The CSSU is quickly growing up, so we're taking the opportunity to refresh the CSSU's identity and bring it up to speed with the modern era with a sleek, clean look to represent our renewed vigour. You'll be seeing changes across the board this year â€“ to our office, posters, merchandise, and more.

Besides, I think most of us have come across some old code and figured it'd just be easier to start fresh, right?

### What happened to WordPress?
Honestly, WordPress was a bit more than what we really needed for this website. The aim of this website is to provide information about things happening around the department, and as you can see, it does exactly that. We've switched to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a fantastic way of creating static webpages with the convenience of being able to easily manage data and templates. Plus, a bunch of these posts are written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), which makes it super easy for us!

### What's next?
Spencer Elliott (the Senior Webmaster) and I are constantly working to improve the website and get new, useful information on it for CS students (like you, probably). Don't like something? Have a question or suggestion? You can get in touch with me at <ey.cheung@mail.utoronto.ca>.

### Okay, but I just want to see the stuff this is made of
You're in luck! All of the source code for this website is [available on our GitHub](https://github.com/cssu/cssu.ca), so go ahead and poke around!
