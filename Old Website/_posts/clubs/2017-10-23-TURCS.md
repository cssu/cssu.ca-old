The group's primary aim is to provide a forum for undergraduate researchers, within the field of computer science, to network, collaborate, and engage in scientific discourse. On a bi-weekly basis, the group will host seminars for undergraduates to discuss their research or interesting scientific papers.

Its secondary goal is to engage more undergraduates in technological research. Toward this end, the group will bring in academic and industry leaders to present talks shedding light onto their careers. Research opportunities will also be promoted through the groupâ€™s social media platforms.

Annually, the group will host an annual conference featuring the best of undergraduate computer science research.
