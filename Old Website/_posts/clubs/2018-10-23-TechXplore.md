TechXplore is a University of Toronto student-run club that operates to provide students with tutorial-style hands-on learning for tech-based projects (i.e. Java, Python, R Programming, 3D Modelling & Printing, etc.). We host a series of events and training modules to help our peers develop a passion and skill-set to succeed in technology-inclined industries.
