        <title>CSSU Blog - Week 2</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the second post of the CSSU Blog our weekly blog series with news, events, tips and everything else you need to know. For those of you who don’t know what this is you can find my first post &lt;a href=&quot;https://cssu.ca/news/2018/10/05/CSSU-update.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. As always thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Tis the season for midterms, assignments, and all the “wonderful” things that make up university life. While the weather has been cooling down, your coursework has been heating up and the CSSU has been busy making plans for lots of events and activities to give you a break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of these tests, assignments, and coursework, you can feel overwhelmed. Make sure that you’re taking care of yourself; stress is serious. You can visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://cssu.ca/heath&quot;&gt;our health page&lt;/a&gt; for health resources and if you ever need a place to relax the CSSU is here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, let’s get into this week’s content:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;news&quot;&gt;News:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The CSSU is having its first open General Member Meeting of the year on Thursday Oct. 18th from 5pm - 6:30pm. The executives and general council  will be speaking about the work they have been doing this semester, we hope you’ll come out and make your voice heard. (There will be a full recap written by a guest writer in next week’s post so look forward to it)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The University of Toronto is currently reviewing all Convocations and a group of CS students have spearheaded a campaign to get the university to add a CS convocation similar to Rotman’s and the DCS’s 50th anniversary convocation. Current Signature Count (as of writing) is 444 signatures. You can read the full petition and sign &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.change.org/p/university-of-toronto-convocation-review-committee-let-cs-graduate-together&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Also leave your written comments with the committee on their site &lt;a href=&quot;https://uoftgc.wufoo.eu/forms/u-of-t-convocation-review-2018/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Konrad Group is offering two $2,000 scholarships to third and fourth year Computer Science students. The Digital Innovation Scholarship is open to undergraduate students in the computer science field who are interested in pursuing a career in digital technology. The Women in Technology Scholarship is designed for female undergraduate Computer Science student who’s interested in pursuing a career in digital technology.

Applications are due Oct 22, 2018.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In more scholarship news, the Canada Chinese Computer Association Scholarship in Computer Science is taking applications. For requirements and application details &lt;a href=&quot;https://bb.teach.cs.toronto.edu/t/canada-chinese-computer-association-scholarship-in-computer-science/582&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;. Applications are due Wed Oct 31, 2018.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Google has a bunch of scholarships open for &lt;a href=&quot;https://bb.teach.cs.toronto.edu/t/more-google-scholarships/931&quot;&gt;applications&lt;/a&gt;. (Way too many for me to list so I’m going to save time and let you click the link to read it).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In non-scholarship news, for the sci-fi/Frankenstein fans, St. Michael’s College is having a week long series of events celebrating the 200th anniversary of Frankenstein (the book). From Oct 24-31 2018. For more details &lt;a href=&quot;https://bb.teach.cs.toronto.edu/uploads/default/original/1X/e4eea7838388a039b3474deebe98d750863f2002.pdf&quot;&gt;read the poster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;events&quot;&gt;Events&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;upcoming-events&quot;&gt;Upcoming events:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Oct 16th 7pm CSSU Screening: Black Mirror: We’re going to be screening Black Mirror with popcorn so get some friends and come down to relax and enjoy some scary episodes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Oct 17th 12-2pm CS Grad School Info Session BA2185: If you are interested  in doing grad studies in CS join Associate Professor and Associate Chair, Graduate Studies in the Department of Computer Science Angela Demke Brown and Matt Medland, Assistant Professor, Teaching Stream and Managing Director of Professional Programs (MScAC) for an in-depth info session on what Grad School is and how to make your application stand out.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Oct 23rd 6pm Ethics of AI Film Series WALL-E, Centre for Ethics, 200 Larkin Street: Personally WALL-E is one of my favorite films and if you have not seen it you should. The Center of Ethics is screening the film with Mark Kingwell from the Philosophy Department to talk about the Ethics of AI and how they apply in the film. For more info &lt;a href=&quot;https://ethics.utoronto.ca/ethics-of-ai-film-series/&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tip-of-the-week&quot;&gt;Tip of the week&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can SSH onto the teaching labs from your personal computer with your username and password. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/using_cdf/ssh.html&quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt; for details on how to set it up (Putty is brilliant for windows). This is really useful for when you need to run your code on the teach machines (for 2nd year and above courses where compiling and running C code on windows is a pain) without needing to be in the lab. For the veteran users who know that already, there are actually multiple servers that you can ssh into if the main one is really busy (really helps in high traffic times like when a CSC369 or CSC320 assignment is due or MATLAB). yelp and jwebb are the servers and all you need is to ssh into the regular teach.cs.toronto.edu and from there ssh (server_name), remember to use the machines responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interesting-links&quot;&gt;Interesting Links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If on the off chance that UOFT is ever closed, you can check the status of the campus at any time &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.utoronto.ca/campus-status&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have updated and uploaded a new office code &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FI7NU-B-lHJq7C7jKqhQ2XCHG-a4njXFYUH-EVZEGJE&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; feel free to give us some feedback!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading, and I hope you enjoyed it. If you have any feedback, feel free to email us, comment on the facebook/reddit post, or come to the CSSU to talk to us (or to this week’s General Meeting).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a great week!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>CSSU Blog - Hello World</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So hopefully you’ve been getting into the swing of things, whether you’re a first year or finishing up your degree on behalf of the CSSU I hope you’ve been had a great first month back. The CSSU has also been busy this past month prepping lots of great events and things for you to make the most of your experience here at UofT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Anujan and I’m this year’s CSSU webmaster, this past summer myself along with Clara wrote the CSSU’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cssu.ca/firstyearcs&quot;&gt;First Year Guide to CS&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve received a tremendous response from students both incoming first years and current students. We’ve heard the feedback and hope that we can update and build on that guide going forward and create more great content for all CS students. This series of news posts are a part of that effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal in these posts is to give you a “one-stop” shop for all the DCS, UofT and interesting news that will hopefully make you aware of whats happing and will happen. Information is spread out through a lot of different locations and hopefully I can bring some really interesting things to your attention. While this won’t be fully comprehensive, I think I can try my best :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This “Blog” will hopefully be published every week on cssu.ca with the CS news you need to know about, upcoming events and tips and tricks. In upcoming posts I hope to add lots of interesting content whether guest writers, interviews and maybe a space for readers like you to submit your content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, let’s get into the content:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;news&quot;&gt;News:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.cs.toronto.edu/news/current/U_of_T_s_Michelle_Craig_wins_prestigious_OCUFA_teaching_award.htm&quot;&gt;CS Department&lt;/a&gt;, Professor Michelle Craig has been named one of Ontario’s most outstanding university teachers by the Ontario Confederation of University Faculty Associations (OCUFA) for the 2017-2018 year. Professor Craig has taught many CS courses at the undergrad level such as CSC343 and CSC209. She is also one of the creators of the PCRS C modules which is used in CSC209 to supplement learning in the course though preparatory videos and exercises. If you see her around please congratulate her on this wonderful achievement.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The University of Toronto is currently reviewing all Convocations and a group of CS students has spearheaded a campaign to get the university to add a CS convocation similar to Rotman’s and the DCS’s 50th anniversary convocation. You can read the full petition and sign &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.change.org/p/university-of-toronto-convocation-review-committee-let-cs-graduate-together&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Konrad Group is offering two $2,000 scholarships to third and fourth year Computer Science students. The Digital Innovation Scholarship is open to undergraduate students in the computer science field who are interested in pursuing a career in digital technology. The Women in Technology Scholarship was designed for female undergraduate Computer Science student who’s interested in pursuing a career in digital technology.

  &lt;li&gt;While it seemed to have been a slow CS news week here at UofT, I thought I would share some “recent” achievements of CS undergrads to possibly inspire you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Samin Khan (4th Year CS Student) this summer won Microsoft’s Imagine Cup along with his teammate from UOIT. Imagine Cup is a worldwide competition where students pitch new ideas and products that can help people. Read more &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.cs.toronto.edu/news/current/global_innovation_competition.htm?DateTime=636707014200000000&amp;amp;PageMode=View&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for Nina’s Interview with him about his experience, inspiration and whats he’s doing next.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Along with him another undergraduate student who’s done some cool things this summer is Lana El Sanyoura (finished her 3rd year and will being her final year in 2019 after PEY) (also full disclosure Lana was a member of the CSSU last year as noted in the article). She interned at MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab within IBM Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts working with leading AI researchers and professors. You can read her interview by Nina &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.cs.toronto.edu/news/current/U_of_T_computer_science_undergrad_interns_at_MIT-IBM_Watson_AI_Lab.htm?DateTime=636718267800000000&amp;amp;PageMode=View&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
