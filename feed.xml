        <title>POST Statistics Breakdown</title>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The University of Toronto now uses the term ‘program’ in replacement of ‘POSt’, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;POSt ≡ program&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many of you know, CS program admission is one of the most stressful things for new CS students at St. George. Every year since 2014, there has been a cutoff – an average of CSC165 and CSC148 marks – that determines the students who get into the program. There is some misinformation about why it exists and how it works. We hope here to give you a fuller picture, and as much data as possible to allow you to make informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason that we have rigorous admission requirements is a limitation of space, instructors, and TAs. The department lacks the resources to operate courses that can fit everyone who is interested. These bounds are the result of complex interactions between the Faculty of Arts &amp;amp; Science, the Department, and outside forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The admissions process uses an in-stream/out-stream categorization system. When applying from highschool you are allowed to apply to the CS stream (CMP1). The CMP1 stream has a higher admission average than most and in turn offers mild leniency when applying to the program. What many applicants fail to understand is that you are not in the program until you apply and accept an offer after completing CSC148 and CSC165 (this is also why you are not charged deregulated CS Fees in your first year but “general” artsci fees). Beyond the students who are in-stream (CMP1), any students who has taken CSC165 and CSC148 are allowed to apply to the program. There are many students who explore CS courses, find that they enjoy it, and decide to pursue it as one of their fields of study. As seen in the chart below this make up a sizeable number of the overall applicants to the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department is taking steps to increase its faculty size and teaching capacity to try and accept more students, but the continuously increasing cutoff is only a reflection of the continuously increasing quality and competitiveness of students applying. The gist of how these cutoffs are calculated is basically such:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sort applicants in decreasing order of their averages (CSC148 &amp;amp; CSC165)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select top &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; students, where &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is the number of spots in the program for the following year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admissions is split into two rounds, one following the close of the winter session and another following the close of the summer session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following chart was provided after requests to the department for more concrete information. This comparison is between 2017 and 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;td&gt;122&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;186&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;79&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;63&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;253&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;62&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;411&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;155&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;272&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;55&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Total&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;271&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;96&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;113&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;16&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;788&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;319&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;264&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;114&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;87&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;399&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;111&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;679&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;303&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;329&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;65&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/tbody&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This is the first year of Data Science, a joint program with CS and Stats.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is typically a predetermined number of positions available in the program each year (Major + Spec., see table below). The total number of offers should exceed that slightly as not every offer is accepted. Transfer students have also been excluded above. Note that not all students in CMP1 decided to pursue a CS Major/Specialist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is the number of applications versus offers for the major and specialist program over the years as taken from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.cs.toronto.edu/program/ugrad/admission.htm&quot;&gt;department site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;overflow-x:auto; width:95vw;&quot;&gt;
&lt;table cellspacing=&quot;3&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
   &lt;tbody align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
       &lt;tr&gt;
           &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Year:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
           &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2014&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
           &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2015&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
           &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2016&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
           &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2017&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
           &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2018&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
       &lt;/tr&gt;
       &lt;tr&gt;
           &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Number of Applications:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
           &lt;td&gt;537&lt;/td&gt;
           &lt;td&gt;647&lt;/td&gt;
           &lt;td&gt;841&lt;/td&gt;
           &lt;td&gt;828&lt;/td&gt;
           &lt;td&gt;981&lt;/td&gt;
       &lt;/tr&gt;
       &lt;tr&gt;
           &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Number of Admissions*:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
           &lt;td&gt;453&lt;/td&gt;
           &lt;td&gt;539&lt;/td&gt;
           &lt;td&gt;567&lt;/td&gt;
           &lt;td&gt;475&lt;/td&gt;
           &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;TBA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
       &lt;/tr&gt;
   &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There used to be the cutoff averages for these years posted on the department site. The department now feels that this is not a beneficial indicator for students. If one year of applicants were to do especially poor (or CSC165 and CSC148 were especially difficult) the cutoff for that year would sink. If another were to do especially well it would rise. While many may take comfort in having a definite goal, these historical cutoffs may not represent the current requirements for the program. The cutoff is basically the average of the student with the lowest marks to get into the program at that given time. If you would like to know more please get in touch with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would like to thank Francois Pitt and the department for their help in giving us these numbers and their permission to release them to the public. Francois also talked on last years &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/room-2250/s1e2-the-pitt-questions&quot;&gt;Room 2250 Episode&lt;/a&gt; about the program if you want further information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we get more information, we will update this post. We hope this has helped you and if you have any feedback feel free to let us know. Feel free to open a PR on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cssu/cssu.ca/blob/draft/_posts/news/2018-10-24-POST-numbers.md&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; if you would like to contribute :)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>CSSU Blog - Week 2</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the second post of the CSSU Blog our weekly blog series with news, events, tips and everything else you need to know. For those of you who don’t know what this is you can find my first post &lt;a href=&quot;https://cssu.ca/news/2018/10/05/CSSU-update.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. As always thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Tis the season for midterms, assignments, and all the “wonderful” things that make up university life. While the weather has been cooling down, your coursework has been heating up and the CSSU has been busy making plans for lots of events and activities to give you a break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of these tests, assignments, and coursework, you can feel overwhelmed. Make sure that you’re taking care of yourself; stress is serious. You can visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://cssu.ca/heath&quot;&gt;our health page&lt;/a&gt; for health resources and if you ever need a place to relax the CSSU is here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, let’s get into this week’s content:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;news&quot;&gt;News:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The CSSU is having its first open General Member Meeting of the year on Thursday Oct. 18th from 5pm - 6:30pm. The executives and general council  will be speaking about the work they have been doing this semester, we hope you’ll come out and make your voice heard. (There will be a full recap written by a guest writer in next week’s post so look forward to it)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tip-of-the-week&quot;&gt;Tip of the week&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can SSH onto the teaching labs from your personal computer with your username and password. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/using_cdf/ssh.html&quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt; for details on how to set it up (Putty is brilliant for windows). This is really useful for when you need to run your code on the teach machines (for 2nd year and above courses where compiling and running C code on windows is a pain) without needing to be in the lab. For the veteran users who know that already, there are actually multiple servers that you can ssh into if the main one is really busy (really helps in high traffic times like when a CSC369 or CSC320 assignment is due or MATLAB). yelp and jwebb are the servers and all you need is to ssh into the regular teach.cs.toronto.edu and from there ssh (server_name), remember to use the machines responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interesting-links&quot;&gt;Interesting Links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If on the off chance that UOFT is ever closed, you can check the status of the campus at any time &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.utoronto.ca/campus-status&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have updated and uploaded a new office code &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FI7NU-B-lHJq7C7jKqhQ2XCHG-a4njXFYUH-EVZEGJE&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; feel free to give us some feedback!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading, and I hope you enjoyed it. If you have any feedback, feel free to email us, comment on the facebook/reddit post, or come to the CSSU to talk to us (or to this week’s General Meeting).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a great week!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>CSSU Blog - Hello World</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So hopefully you’ve been getting into the swing of things, whether you’re a first year or finishing up your degree on behalf of the CSSU I hope you’ve been had a great first month back. The CSSU has also been busy this past month prepping lots of great events and things for you to make the most of your experience here at UofT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Anujan and I’m this year’s CSSU webmaster, this past summer myself along with Clara wrote the CSSU’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cssu.ca/firstyearcs&quot;&gt;First Year Guide to CS&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve received a tremendous response from students both incoming first years and current students. We’ve heard the feedback and hope that we can update and build on that guide going forward and create more great content for all CS students. This series of news posts are a part of that effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal in these posts is to give you a “one-stop” shop for all the DCS, UofT and interesting news that will hopefully make you aware of whats happing and will happen. Information is spread out through a lot of different locations and hopefully I can bring some really interesting things to your attention. While this won’t be fully comprehensive, I think I can try my best :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This “Blog” will hopefully be published every week on cssu.ca with the CS news you need to know about, upcoming events and tips and tricks. In upcoming posts I hope to add lots of interesting content whether guest writers, interviews and maybe a space for readers like you to submit your content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, let’s get into the content:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;news&quot;&gt;News:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.cs.toronto.edu/news/current/U_of_T_s_Michelle_Craig_wins_prestigious_OCUFA_teaching_award.htm&quot;&gt;CS Department&lt;/a&gt;, Professor Michelle Craig has been named one of Ontario’s most outstanding university teachers by the Ontario Confederation of University Faculty Associations (OCUFA) for the 2017-2018 year. Professor Craig has taught many CS courses at the undergrad level such as CSC343 and CSC209. She is also one of the creators of the PCRS C modules which is used in CSC209 to supplement learning in the course though preparatory videos and exercises. If you see her around please congratulate her on this wonderful achievement.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The University of Toronto is currently reviewing all Convocations and a group of CS students has spearheaded a campaign to get the university to add a CS convocation similar to Rotman’s and the DCS’s 50th anniversary convocation. You can read the full petition and sign &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.change.org/p/university-of-toronto-convocation-review-committee-let-cs-graduate-together&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

The Digital Innovation Scholarship is open to undergraduate students in the computer science field who are interested in pursuing a career in digital technology. The Women in Technology Scholarship was designed for female undergraduate Computer Science student who’s interested in pursuing a career in digital technology.

  &lt;li&gt;While it seemed to have been a slow CS news week here at UofT, I thought I would share some “recent” achievements of CS undergrads to possibly inspire you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Samin Khan (4th Year CS Student) this summer won Microsoft’s Imagine Cup along with his teammate from UOIT. Imagine Cup is a worldwide competition where students pitch new ideas and products that can help people. Read more &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.cs.toronto.edu/news/current/global_innovation_competition.htm?DateTime=636707014200000000&amp;amp;PageMode=View&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for Nina’s Interview with him about his experience, inspiration and whats he’s doing next.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Along with him another undergraduate student who’s done some cool things this summer is Lana El Sanyoura (finished her 3rd year and will being her final year in 2019 after PEY) (also full disclosure Lana was a member of the CSSU last year as noted in the article). She interned at MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab within IBM Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts working with leading AI researchers and professors. You can read her interview by Nina &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.cs.toronto.edu/news/current/U_of_T_computer_science_undergrad_interns_at_MIT-IBM_Watson_AI_Lab.htm?DateTime=636718267800000000&amp;amp;PageMode=View&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
