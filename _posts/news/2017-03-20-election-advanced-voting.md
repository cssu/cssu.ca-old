An advanced voting form is now available:
[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1elSM1Z6u_a-pkIFjuuB599ZQ_pPYUmp3htg3l7iHeBg/edit?usp=sharing](download here).

Please print off the form, complete it, and contact the CRO at [xtina.chen@mail.utoronto.ca](mailto:xtina.chen@mail.utoronto.ca) after the conclusion of the nomination period but no less than 48 hours before the start of the voting period to arrange for pick-up of your ballot. At pick-up, you will be asked for your TCard to verify identity and eligibility.

To complete your ballot, put a checkmark next to the name of the candidate you wish to vote for. If you check off less than or more than one candidate for any position, your vote will be considered spoiled for that position. Seal the completed ballot in the envelope that will be provided to you by the CRO when you receive your ballot. Do substitute any other envelope, and do not mark the outside of the envelope in any way. Contact the CRO before the conclusion of the voting period to arrange for drop-off your ballot. Votes may not be modified after submission of an advanced ballot.
