The UofT WiCS club aims to:

Create a positive space on campus for all genders and sexual orientations by 
accepting everyone who wants to join our group, and conducting meetings and other 
events. 

Create a social support network for self-identified women in computer science 
programs and courses at the University of Toronto, St George Campus by conducting 
meeting and other social events. 

Provide and/or contribute to outreach and diversity programs for prospective and 
first-year self-identified female students in Computer Science by encouraging them to 
come to our meetings and collaborating with some high/secondary schools. 

Promote networking and informational opportunities for our members by providing 
information about latest conferences and talks and funding some members to attend 
these conferences/talks. 

Prompt a dialogue related to diversity/minority issues within technical and scientific 
fields, particularly with respect to computer science and related disciplines by attending 
meeting to other groups like Women in Computer Science/Engineering and inviting 
guests or faculty member to talk about related topics.
